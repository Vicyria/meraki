                    I'm passionate about making French learning immersive, practical, and confidence-building.
                    I love learning languages and using that curiosity to stay connected with my students' experiences.
                    <br></br>I believe in teaching French through real-life situations, while also valuing how memorisation helps build a strong foundation.
                    My mission? To help you gain confidence and actually use French for work, study, or personal growth.
